The world of Kazar is thought by many historians to have come into being many millions of years ago, evidenced by the age of the glaciers in Stormfyord. But it was not until The Stirring (Ca. 35.000 BT) , a time of great volcanic unrest, that the northern country finally emerged, which later became the Trifectum.

Spread across the narrow peninsula lived the greatly segregated peoples of the elves and dwarves, though much later they were joined by humans, gnomes and halflings who sailed across the troublesome seas as settlers in the year of 430 BT.

After centuries of uneasy isolation, a great submarine volcano, Vallaka's Maw, erupted in the south, tearing asunder the Gulf of Kazar (1 BT). The city of Soskni was almost destroyed as lava ran rampant across the land. But, recovering from the disaster, the survivors realised they could tame the steam for their own uses.

The ensuing scramble to capitalise on this newly discovered resource was so immediate and violent that chief diplomats were elected from each of the three nations. Upon meeting they realized a possibility existed, a union of three, which would unite the country as a whole, and propel the three leaders to an unprecedented level of power.

The three elected officials named themselves the Trifecta, forcing by strength of their allies their entire people to fall in line, while simultaneously extracting themselves from their lands of origin. Upon the steaming lake they built a castle of pure glass, naming it Arc-upon-High.

Symbol of the Trifecta. The fourth stone symbolises the unification of Kazar. Without the three lights of the Trifecta it would be extinguished.

Today the Trifectum is ruled by:

The elven king, Efrael and his son Prince Calder. Their reign - eternal
The human president-elect, Morgana de Floc. Her position - indisputable
The dwarven duke, Burghoul the Wide. His enemies â€“ constantly bickering
A new order was quickly established in Kazar, as the power of industry cemented the fledgling nation as the leader in world politics. The ancient nations of Vergenwell, Fuhdain and Chytyr could do naught but gawp at the technology emerging from the Trifecta's factories.

But all of this would be nothing compared to The Line, and its import on the world.
