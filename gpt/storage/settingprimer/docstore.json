Chronicles can be freely written in Common.\n\nTechnology and fashion are evolving rapidly, introducing all sorts of new quirks for your Dungeons & Dragons character. But while firearms are in the process of being invented, considered by many more of a risk to the user than the target, they have yet to replace the more conventional weapons such as swords and bows.\n\nHere are a few things to keep in mind when you start creating your character in the Kazar setting:\n\n\nCalendar\nFollowing the ascension of the Trifecta a new calendar was established. There was now to be Before Trifecta (BT) and Post Trifecta (PT). Our story begins in the year 50 Post Trifecta, with the call for Expeditions.\n\nRace\nSome of the races in Kazar differ slightly from their descriptions in the Player's Handbook. Be sure to consult the People of Kazar page for inspiration.\n\nClass\nAll class options published by Wizards of the Coast are available. No Unearthed Arcana.\n\nMagic\nAll forms of magic are strictly regulated by the Trifecta. Strict laws issued by the Trifectian Magi limit all magic users to a certain spell level and amounts of uses. This constitutes the \"spell slot\" gameplay aspect of Dungeons & Dragons. Upon achieving higher levels you are slowly being permitted by the Trifectian Magi to learn and use more powerful spells (represented by numbered patches worn on your outer jacket). Spell slots are therefore not limited in the same way, but breaking the law could have terrible consequences.\n\nCosmetics\nAlthough swords and bows still make up the bulk of the kind of weapons you can wield, feel free to embellish their designs with mechanical cosmetics. Perhaps the crossbow has a steam powered reload function? The sword a retracting hilt? Cosmetic details will help your character stand out in a steampunk fantasy world.\n\nExperience points\nExperience points work in a different manner in Kazar. Learn more here: Experience point guide\n\nBackground\nThere are several custom backgrounds tailored to suit the setting, for those who want their characters to feel even more attuned to the world at large. Read more about their benefits here:\n\nLine Worker\nInventor\nTreesinger\nChild of Industry\nTheology\n\nKazar is independent from the Forgotten Realms and none of the deities mentioned in the Player's Handbook apply when creating a character. If you require a deity for your Paladin or Cleric, select one from the Pantheon of Kazar.\n\nExclusions\nDrow do not exist, and therefore are not a playable race in Kazar. Unless specifically requested, the only races available for play are those included in the Player's Handbook.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2916, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/ref_doc_info": {"3a8343af-a335-47c1-8100-3a956c777953": {"node_ids": ["5cbc451e-f45e-4ff3-86ec-ff220af8de44"], "metadata": {}}}}
