Here follows a list of main places of interest, that serve as destinations for various expeditions by the crew of Stone-Upon-Hill.\n\nContents\n1\tThe Vale of Blossoms\n2\tThe Wizard's Castle\n3\tThe Sunken Ruins\n4\tThe Rift\n5\tTroll Bridges\n6\tDesert Disaster\n7\tBlack Marrow\nThe Vale of Blossoms\n\nHidden behind a purple barrier of light lies a strange, otherworldly valley, home to The Blossom Queen. Its inhabitants appear to be a creation of her spurned psyche, after being rejected by an unknown lover. Currently dangerous, as her rage has become the dominant emotion.\n\nThe Wizard's Castle\nThe ancient castle of a mysterious wizard called Quen Carellon, inhabited by sentient furniture that appears to be at war with living armors. Most furniture is killed, apart from Puff and his pet Carpet. Further progress is barred until the main armor is defeated, but Quen appears to still live at the top of the tower.\n\nThe Sunken Ruins\nAn old fortress or crypt belonging to the royal Hrakk family of dwarfs, haunted by their undead remains. Major players are King Hrakk, the princess magician Dimra Hrakk, and the warrior prince Vondur Hrakk. Only Vondur is still unaccounted for, the two others' undead selves have been defeated and laid to rest.\n\nThe Rift\nDesolate area with large cracks in the ground, guarded by a powerful roc named Almavat. Cracks lead to an underground dwarf (Hrakk?) fortress now populated by red lizards worshipping dwarfs as mythical creatures. Underground magma rivers may possibly be traversed by Vondur Hrakk's ship, kept behind High Priest Qaleq's chambers.\n\nTroll Bridges\nMassive stone bridges above a stormy sea with a terrifying creature under the waves. Guarded by three successively larger trolls: Pog (dead), Drett and Grog. They seem increasingly afflicted by boils caused by the fog or spores in a jungle at the end of the final, largest bridge, which also makes them immune to the fog. Bulu Kasil, the castle with the lighted window which is the origin of the fog, lies at the end of the final bridge.\n\nDesert Disaster\n\nBlack Marrow\nA black and uninviting maw in the mountains, leading to a dark hall. It's barred with spikes, perhaps to keep something locked away. Tracks on the ground indicate it may once have been a mine belonging to the Hrakks. It is now filled with headless corpses and dangerous beholders.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2450, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/ref_doc_info": {"f512ab9b-b558-427d-b900-71736c34ac76": {"node_ids": ["0b4c381c-bb58-46af-8dbe-4b861ab713f6"], "metadata": {}}}}
