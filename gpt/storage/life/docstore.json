The architecture is foreign to all who visit, as there are no markings or inscriptions of any sorts within its labyrinthian corridors. For while the entirety of the citadel has been explored, only the uppermost quarters are in use. Adventurers in the employ of the Trifecta Line Company are given their own rooms, simply furnished with a bed, a wardrobe and a heated sink and tub. Steam drawn from the depths of the mountain ensures a comfortable heated floor, with windows facing northward, towards the Stormfyord.\n\n\nLife at Stone-upon-hill\n\nStone-upon-hill is the end of the Line, and the Trifecta Line Companies' forward operating base for Expeditions in Stormfyord.\nIn September of the year 50 PT the Trifecta Line Company issued a call for recruits throughout all of Kazar. Daring souls who wished to ride the Steam Singers to the very edge of the known world. To risk their lives in discovering what lay beyond the fog covered lands of Stormfyord.\nThis section is dedicated to acquainting would-be travellers with the ancient citadel.\n\nSasha Yarna, Officer of the Line and head of security at Stone-Upon-hill. You'll have to speak to her to get an Expedition going\n\nA glorious new project begun in the year of 50 PT, Expeditions are forays into the unknown wilds of Stormfyord.\nThe Trifecta Line Company has a singular goal in mind: To connect the Line to the very northernmost reaches of Kazar. Despite many attempts, work has finally ground to a halt on the Line, the fog in Stormfyord proving too great an obstacle. Instead volunteers have been summoned from all over Kazar to investigate the region.\nThe lucky few granted a one-way ticket to Stone-upon-hill are encouraged to venture out when they have a target in mind, as well as a fellowship formed with other employees. As the fog only recedes once a week there is plenty of time to prepare. To avoid risking the entire workforce a maximum of five riders are sent out at any one time.\nAs enforced by the Watcher, a group returning from an Expedition is to be quarantined for a week, to ensure no symptoms emerge from exposure to the fog in the valley. What these symptoms are, however, few know. In the meantime other groups gather, ensuring there is always an Expedition raring to go.\nBut after a week has passed one is back in rotation. Ready for glorious discovery!\n\nGameplay\nExpeditions are single session forays into the Stormfyord. A group elects a destination and a date prior to playing. When they eventually retreat at the end of the session, the fog returns to cover the valley. Between each individual session one week passes in-game. So, if you are in decontamination, you are forced to sit out at least one session before being able to return to Stormfyord.\nEvery member of an Expedition is paid 75 gold. The Chronicler is paid an additional 50 gold.\n\nExpress Decontamination\nIf it is impossible to fully staff an Expedition with the available characters it is possible to enact Express Decontamination. The character in question foregoes their 7 days of downtime and is immediately prepared for departure. This is only possible if all available players have declined to play.\n\nDowntime\nEvery session played moves the story 7 days forward. It is possible for your character to keep themselves busy during this time. Activities can not generate gold unless agreed upon with the DM.\n\nA character in decontamination is automatically granted 14 days downtime.\n\nLevelling up\nThe only way to become stronger is to explore the Stormfyord with your allies: Experience point guide.\n\nCrafting\nUsing your downtime to create new useful items for yourself and your allies is a worthwhile pursuit, if you have the talent and the materials required. Kazar has its own guide: Crafting guide.\n\nLoyal Steed\nYou can spend your downtime connecting with your steed. Make an Animal Handling check. If it exceeds 13 your steed receives a loyalty point. The more points the greater chance it will intuitively understand and obey your wishes.\n\nThe DC increases by 1 per loyalty point. Example: Your steed has 1 loyalty point from a previous success. To increase it to 2 loyalty points the DC is 14.\n\nDeath in Kazar\nThere is high risk involved when setting out on an Expedition. If your character should perish you can create a new one with the same amount of experience points as the group average. This should be seen as an incentive to ensure that no player falls too far behind. Or you can elect to leave the Kazar campaign, opening up a slot for new players to join.\n\nDM'ing in Kazar\nThe Expedition format allows for other Dungeon Master's to try their hand at guiding a party on an adventure: Kazar Co-DM Guide", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4803, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "4db2eb65-7cac-44cc-973f-56d8854ad44d": {"__data__": {"id_": "4db2eb65-7cac-44cc-973f-56d8854ad44d", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "39225c39-abcd-4552-8708-9e4b7090d21b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "843080d47472372bd42f288ab8d5c90eba112c9d947ca892888c8e335caa6b07", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "5cc9a155-85c4-426b-a00e-71ab35c293e4", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "19af35b7c1756736db024372e318d4f48fc1aa6d9cd0aa2cdea966d31ae17e94", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "e26142a2ad00b4b966be6b5160db1fd79a15ea3ea1616e7699bba86b389080c6", "text": "The Tavern\nRun by Zagog and her dwarven cooks, the tavern is a wide hall below the last standing tower, devoid of windows. Lit by scented candles, steamy mugs of Glaag served to every table. The fireplace always lit, logs crackling. All meals are enjoyed in the tavern, provided free of charge to all contract workers. Many spend their days off reading in one of the many comfy chairs, or playing cards with other adventurers. A place to share the latest gossip and daydream of home.\n\nDISCORD: The Tavern channel serves as a general chat room where adventurers are free to discuss whatever is on their minds. But if you make too much noise Zagog might come wheeling by to tell you off.\n\nThe Bazaar\nWell decorated and full of wonders, the Bazaar is worth a visit for any adventurer\nTimian Pestle's domain, situated on the southern tip of the citadel, the Bazaar is an ancient hall which faintly resembles a church. Its walls are bedecked with wonderful artworks and paintings from Pestle's private collection. Elegant silks and fabrics cover the windows, casting a multicoloured light across the chamber. Timian himself resides in an adjoining chamber, where he often entertains merchant colleagues who have travelled to satisfy their curiosity of this distant region. Others come to trade with the workers themselves, hoping to curry favour with the Trifecta by peddling goods to the frontier.\n\nDISCORD: All purchases are to be registered in the Bazaar. Trade with Timian Pestle is automatic, as he can sell any item from the Player's handbook. He is a shrewd trader, always looking for a good deal. He can buy used inventory items for half their original value.\n\nThe Chroniclers tower\nOf the four towers believed once to have perched upon each corner of the battlements, only one remains. A winding stair leads to a circular study overflowing with ancient texts and modern books. Here Chronicles are promptly delivered to Glory, who records them for distribution. Seldom does Glory leave her room, preferring for the dwarven cooks to deliver her food to her heated chambers. Visitors are forced to take off their shoes, as is written in seventeen languages on the door to the tower.\n\nDISCORD: Chronicles are to be posted here when finished. Discussion and questions are to be made in the created thread.\n\nStation house\nOfficial name for the small wooden building situated near the Northern Drawbridge. Built by Sasha herself, it is quite the contrast to the ancient stone surrounding it. Inside is a wide marble desk, procured from the depths of the citadel, upon which all schedules are worked out. Her mechanical leg hindering her from riding out herself, Sasha busies herself with assembling efficient Expeditionary Squads. She regularily interviews workers, cross referencing their skills with the locations described by the Chronicler.\n\nDISCORD: Channel for scheduling Expeditions. Sasha can be consulted for advice as to where to explore next, but her knowledge is limited by that of the Chronicler.\n\nNorthern Drawbridge\n\nThe view from the Northern Drawbridge is breathtaking\n\nConnecting the citadel to the sloping valley of the Stormfyord, the view from the Northern Drawbridge is breathtaking. Verdant green hills tinted by the blue light from the fog. Here stands the Watcher, Darryl Cede, his sightless eyes gazing ever outwards. A stable filled with the finest horses of the realm is situated just by the gate. Riding down the hill towards the valley on an Expedition, the horses galloping at break neck speed to destinations yet unknown, is said to be a thrill unlike any other.\n\nAll Expeditions begin and end here. Except, of course, those who never return from the wilds.\n\nCentral Plaza\nThe main connecting hub of Stone-upon-hill. A bulletin board hangs near the entrance to the tavern, where newspaper clippings from the capitol are carefully curated by the Officers of the Line.\n\nDISCORD: As time passes in Kazar new information regarding the state of the world will be displayed in the plaza channel.", "start_char_idx": 4806, "end_char_idx": 8824, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/ref_doc_info": {"39225c39-abcd-4552-8708-9e4b7090d21b": {"node_ids": ["9c8f2236-5296-41d7-aa9b-536fdd6bf9fa", "5cc9a155-85c4-426b-a00e-71ab35c293e4", "4db2eb65-7cac-44cc-973f-56d8854ad44d"], "metadata": {}}}}
