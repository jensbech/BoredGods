Turned cruel after being touched by the fog. Obsessed with the purple light of the Flower Queen.\nYurret was name of Quen's servant, sent to investigate the Valley of Blossoms. Was taken in as the Queen's consort, turned into a shadow creature, and was killed.\nFlower Queen does not like Quen. Was betrayed in love by someone we don't know yet. Her fractured psyche inhabits the valley to make her feel loved and admired. Is possibly a God (Vallaka?)\nSomeone named Rondo used to visit Quen, to report on an unknown funeral, once alongside an unknown woman. He was engaged to princess Dimra Hrakk, and stole her \"birthright\".\nDwarven skeletons and morbid statues are found throughout Quen's castle and the Sunken Ruins, some of them having killed themselves, pleading for forgiveness.\nA Dwarven village has been crushed by giant rocks. Possibly worshippers of Vallaka (Flower Queen?)\nNear the dwarf village a crater with a red creature/light \u2013 capable of transporting visitors to strange world filled with flat fish. A voice asks in abyssal if they are there \"to stop her\", or if they're going to \"stand in the way\" (oral reports differ).\n\"Hrakk\" and the \"lackeys\" worship bards, according to fragments of (probably) Quen's writings. Makes him feel love. He also writes he cannot travel south.\nStrange threatening creatures inside Aburaguzgul's Bag of Holding riding floats, pointing at our heroes while signing 10 + 3 with their fingers.\nTrolls guarding bridges afflicted by boils caused by blue jungle spores or fog itself, seems to make them immune to the fog. Guards a large castle, called Bulu Kasil according to Rift Lizards, which is also where the mist comes from. Lizard named Kalvek once went there, but never returned.\nHrakk dwarfish royalty of ancient civilization, fortress found underground w/ Vondur Hrakk's ship able to traverse lava.\n\"The Old Ones\" reside in Bulu Kasil, opposed to the plans of Hrakk.\nHrakk has entrusted someone named Potros to create a \"masterpiece\" as part in his grandiose plan, not in the interest of the Old Ones. It seems he was unable to complete it in time, leading to severe retributions from the Old Ones.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2278, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/ref_doc_info": {"68c761bf-fe12-42fe-942b-a9f42b9fd137": {"node_ids": ["1fe6c2cd-152d-421a-8aaa-183039f40d73"], "metadata": {}}}}
