Utriztur, Ignur, and the new one, Maurice.\n\nAnd then a hill. Ritz.\n\nGuzgul his horse, name: Horse, fond of name for Maurice his pony, name Pony.\n\nWas going to kill furniture today. I was looking forward to it. Would set puff on fire.\n\nCame to the castle along the same path.\n\nEverything looked the same.\n\nNew armor emerged from the water out of the moat.\n\nRitz killed armor with an arrow. Great.\n\nPuff emerged in the same place as last time on the top of the castle. Puff was annoying and stupid. As last time.\n\nMaurice was playing cabinetmaker. Ritz played along. Puff was stupid and believed it. Puff is stupid.\n\nPuff warned us about new traps he had set up. I found a bottle that was a trap that went bang when I threw it into the moat.\n\nPuff rolled out the red carpet for the main house.\n\nMaurice played that he had to fix the chest of drawers. Puff ran for parts and tools. Puff is gullible and stupid. We got a lot of information from them.\n\nThe bookshelves of wizarding books were emptied.\n\nThey said it has been over 1000 years since they came to life.\n\nMaster Wizard QC dreamed of other things. About the \"thing\" in the mountain. In the mountain crevasse. The purple light. Would be part of it. Love it. It is located in the west. Did any of the little ones say it was the flower queen?\n\nHe stopped being nice and decent when the fog came. He got weird because he got a little lost in the fog.\n\nHe sent his clever dwarf servant Yurret to the light in the west. Yurret never came back.\n\nThey also talked about Nordborgen. Maybe that's where the armor comes from?\n\nCarpet was gone. Didn't want to say where.\n\nWhile Puff was away we smashed his furniture friends. They called us furniture breakers.\n\nThey bled like living beings.\n\nIgnur found magic stone in the killed dresser. We don't know what it can do yet.\n\nPuff didn't come back.\n\nWe explored the rest of the first floor.\n\nThe chimney led nowhere. Just out to the roof.\n\nGot a good overview of the entire first floor.\n\nMany rooms and spy holes.\n\nPuff watched us while we killed his friends. Puff is not clever, but stupid.\n\nWe found kitchen chair because it smelled bad from his kitchen. We tortured it and got a lot of information from him. In the end we crushed him in the meat grinder that he used to make disgusting mousse food for the wizard.\n\nFirst we got a lot of good torture information.\n\nKitchen chair cooked disgusting food for the wizard.\n\nThe sorcerer not dead as they had otherwise said. But he is not well.\n\nThe wizard is called Quen.\n\nPuff brings food to the wizard.\n\nIt is 1300 years and 15 days since the furniture came to life.\n\nPuff would have thrown us into the grinder eventually.\n\nCarpet had been given an important task on the second floor.\n\nAnd then I put him in the meat grinder.\n\nKitchen chair said Puff rules over the other furniture. Or certain. Now they are broken. Just blanket and puff again.\n\nWho's going to cook for the wizard now that we've broken the kitchen chair?\n\nWe moved on. Found a disgusting room with a lot of disgusting food.\n\nAlso found board.\n\nThis was on the board:\n\n- Thylsdag:\n\nMessenger arrived with bad news. The funeral postponed again. Rondo arrives late afternoon. Should he now be referred to as a Hrakk? Private meeting with Quen. Rondo leaves before sunset. No more visitors.\n\n- Vrensdag:\n\nRondo back with unknown woman. New meeting with Quen. Lasts for several hours. They leave after dark. Quen asks the guards to ride ahead of them to the funeral. We plan to leave at dawn. Will Yurret stay with him?\n\nWe went back and examined several rooms.\n\nFound 9 antique gold coins.\n\nUtrizthur has 1 of them, guzguz has 8 of them.\n\nThere was also a room with a trap with a spear. It hurt AbuGuz.\n\nHere dwarf skeleton. It said \"forgive us, forgive us, forgive us!\" on it. It had stabbed itself to death. Maurice said it was like in the wasteland. Amazing what dwarves can come up with.\n\nThere were a lot of rusty weapons in this room.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4033, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "66ca0d73-9085-4d3e-87cc-b53a012d8150": {"__data__": {"id_": "66ca0d73-9085-4d3e-87cc-b53a012d8150", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "fdbaae55-2b2d-442f-bb38-66af2268d330", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {}, "hash": "02e818ae2d88fa5e446b9014671791302f56900666e896d6abc9af42c2e196df", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "2": {"node_id": "1698e800-3f7e-475d-ac0a-048f50799363", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "851fe05ec4f33910dfb68cf6da4e14a3af0ce5eef478d6298d51dc652beb8b8f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "hash": "da416f4794a08d7229f5a9dce57b632b7ae68673c03e0ab20e68bdf503b7927f", "text": "Private meeting with Quen.

Maybe it's the fog that killed the little thing?\n\nThen we finally went to the stairs.\n\nWe tried to trick it, but we didn't succeed. It disappeared again. It was something with change in stone. Ignur understood something about that. I wanted to jump. Did not succeed. Klompedomp and fell.\n\nWe walked by all the skeletons at the bottom where the stairs were and went to the end.\n\nCould look up to light.\n\nFoghorn began.\n\nMaybe it was high enough up above the fog where the light was?\n\nTriz jumped into guzguz's bag and guzguz his little flying dwarf gadget boom flew the bag open.\n\nWe waited for Triz. But flying dwarf gadget boomers came back with empty bag. We went in the bag and came up.\n\nHere was a room with things and books. Surely emptied next time we come as the other shelves were. Boring.\n\nThe fog entered the building. Not good. We were still in the square part of the building. Not in the tower.\n\nWe jumped in the bag again and little flying dwarf flew us to horses. Here was Utritztur Baltic Sea. Strange.\n\nWe just escaped the fog. When we were home we saw that it is only the top tower that is not covered in the fog. There seems to be a long way to go.\n\nOn the horse ride on the way back, Utriztur said that he had fought with Puff, who said that we were playing with things we did not understand.
