Presented theory: Work of Blossom Queen. Shot down by others. Will keep investigating.\n\nSudden arrival: Dwygthe Lifebringer, informing of flying shadow in pursuit. Shadow identified as roc, mythical predatory bird. Helmut of the belief no such thing. Only trusts \u201cacademic\u201d sources. Live and learn. Two horses killed. Roc too strong for current power level. Escaped through crack in ground, met by red lizard people, speaking Draconic. Interpreter named Motep very welcoming. Taken to underground village as guests.\n\nUnderground village a collapsed dwarfish fortress, rivers of magma leading further (unexplored). Lizard people celebrating \u201cBatzarca\u201d, weekly(?) event when mist recedes, with cocoa and dance. Hides under magma while mist covers area, unharmed. Fiona challenged to dance competition, won.\n\nLizard culture built around fragmentary knowledge of ancient dwarf people, called \u201cMelted Ones\u201d. One lizard named after Vondur Hrakk (the dwarf prince\u2019s name found written in ruins). Lizards explain roc is named Almavat. Mist comes from Castle Bulu Kasil, seen beyond Troll Bridges. Lizard named Kalvek went there, never returned.\n\nGrolsch bargained way into chambers of High Priest Qaleq, b/c dwarf, i.e. Melted One. Lizards visibily impressed, worships dwarfs as Gods. Also worships fire elemental named Neserkhet, claiming to be creator of lizards. Fight ensued, elemental dispatched. Taken to see \u201cHoliness\u201d (common: Helligdommen) \u2013 ancient magma ship of prince Vondur Hrakk, main component of lizard cargo cult. Ship empty.\n\nSound of horn prevented further exploration. Ordered lizards to build cover for us from mist under magma, to use as safehouse between expeditions. Barely escaped Almavat on return, saved by last minute sacrifice of Figma's forest spirit Little Thing (RIP). Recommend bringing at least one (1) dwarf on next expedition, for lizard diplomacy.", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2028, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}}, "docstore/ref_doc_info": {"3e0043c6-3c5d-4e2f-ba94-98e99ccabb07": {"node_ids": ["89099885-61ed-40d4-a59e-1738917d9be5"], "metadata": {}}}}
